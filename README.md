 

I have come up with a new analysis for the students' performance dataset. 

The insights I got from this analysis are as follows

1. Urban area people have secured more grades in all the tests(g1,g2,g3)

2. Age 16 students have secured more marks in g3 in rural regions. 

3. school MS has the lowest scoring and GP is better. and family with GT3 has secured good results. 

4. From the above analysis we got to know GP is a better school than group school, only 11% of the total students' parents are alone and secured less score

5. 88% are together, whose their children secured good marks(donet graph)

6. travel time and study time are inversely proportional. Students with less travel time studied more and secured good marks. have done how fedu,medu, fjob, and mjob affect the average. 

7. Students using more internet have secured less score. 

8. Students who have paid and not paid, family support, and without family support have secured equally. 

9. Students with more romantic and who are involved in more activities have secured less score.
